# Birdie Quest

Birdie Quest is an interactive Flappy Bird-inspired game that utilizes face tracking for gameplay. The player's nose position is tracked via a webcam, allowing them to control the bird's height using head movements. The game is built using **Pygame**, **OpenCV**, and **MediaPipe**.

## Features

- **Face Tracking Controls**: Move your head up and down to control the bird.
- **Classic Flappy Bird Mechanics**: Navigate through obstacles to achieve a high score.
- **Dynamic Background and Sprites**: Smooth animations for an immersive experience.
